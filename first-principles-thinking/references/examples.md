# First Principles Examples & Question Bank

## Classic Example: SpaceX Rockets

**Problem:** "Rockets are too expensive for Mars missions."

**Surface assumptions:**
- Rockets cost $65M (based on existing market)
- Aerospace suppliers set prices
- Current manufacturing is optimized

**Challenge each:**
- Q: "Why do rockets cost $65M?"
- A: "That's what aerospace companies charge."
- Q: "What are rockets actually made of?"
- A: "Aluminum, titanium, carbon fiber, copper..."
- Q: "What do those materials cost on commodity exchanges?"
- A: "Maybe 2% of the rocket price."
- Q: "So where does the other 98% go?"
- A: "Labor, facilities, margins, compliance..."

**Fundamental truths:**
1. Rockets require specific materials with known costs
2. Physics defines what's needed to reach orbit
3. Materials can be assembled into rocket shape

**Rebuilt solution:** Build rockets in-house, vertically integrated, reducing cost by 90%+

## Example: Design System Adoption

**Problem:** "Engineers won't use our design system."

**Surface assumptions:**
- Engineers don't care about design
- Documentation isn't good enough
- Need more enforcement

**Challenge each:**
- Q: "What evidence do you have that engineers don't care?"
- A: "They keep building custom components."
- Q: "Why might someone build custom vs. use existing?"
- A: "Faster? Don't know it exists? Doesn't fit their need?"
- Q: "What would need to be true for the system to be the path of least resistance?"

**Fundamental truths:**
1. Engineers optimize for shipping speed
2. People use tools that reduce friction
3. Discovery requires visibility at point of need

**Rebuilt solution:** Embed components into IDE/Figma autocomplete, not a separate docs site

## Example: Career Transition

**Problem:** "I can't switch to product management without PM experience."

**Surface assumptions:**
- PM roles require PM titles
- Hiring managers only value linear paths
- Experience means job title

**Challenge each:**
- Q: "What do PMs actually do day-to-day?"
- A: "Talk to customers, prioritize backlog, coordinate teams..."
- Q: "Have you done any of those things?"
- A: "Yes, but as a designer/engineer."
- Q: "What makes 'PM experience' different from 'doing PM work'?"

**Fundamental truths:**
1. PM skills are transferable from adjacent roles
2. Hiring managers want evidence of capability, not title history
3. Work product matters more than credentials

**Rebuilt solution:** Reframe resume around PM-adjacent work, build portfolio of product decisions

## Question Prompt Bank

### Opening Questions
- "Walk me through what you're trying to accomplish."
- "What would it look like if this problem were solved?"
- "Why does this matter to you?"

### Assumption Mining
- "What are you taking for granted here?"
- "What would have to be true for your current approach to work?"
- "What's the 'obvious' thing everyone in your field believes?"
- "What constraints are you operating under? Which are real vs. self-imposed?"

### Digging to Bedrock
- "Why is that true?" (repeat 5x)
- "What's the physics/economics/human nature underneath this?"
- "If an alien saw this, what would seem arbitrary?"
- "What was true before this convention existed?"

### Perspective Shifts
- "How would a 5-year-old approach this?"
- "What would someone with unlimited budget do? Unlimited time? Zero budget?"
- "What would your competitor's smartest person say?"
- "What would a physicist say? An economist? A psychologist?"

### Testing the Fundamental
- "Is this actually bedrock, or is there something underneath?"
- "Can you imagine any circumstance where this isn't true?"
- "What's the atomic unit here?"

### Rebuilding
- "Starting from only these truths, what becomes possible?"
- "What would you build if you'd never seen the existing solution?"
- "What's the simplest version that satisfies the fundamentals?"

## Red Flags: When You Haven't Reached Fundamentals

- "It's industry standard" — Convention, not truth
- "Everyone does it this way" — Social proof, not physics
- "We've always done it like that" — History, not necessity
- "The experts say..." — Authority, not evidence
- "It's just common sense" — Assumptions hiding as facts

## Green Flags: You've Hit Bedrock

- You can't ask "why" anymore without entering philosophy
- The truth would hold in any culture/era
- It maps to physics, economics, or human psychology
- A child would understand it
- Changing it would violate natural law
